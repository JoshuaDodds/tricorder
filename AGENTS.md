## For Automated AI/LLM Agents
IMPORTANT:
Before starting to work and after checking out code:
1. Ensure the `origin` remote exists and points to the GitHub repo. Do not remove it! You will need it later. If it was removed, re-add it.

Naming discipline when tickets are referenced:
- Detect Jira keys in the format `<PROJECT>-<int>` using regex `\b[A-Z][A-Z0-9]+-\d+\b` across instructions, attachments, or assets.
- If a key is present, immediately transition the Jira issue from **To Do** to **In Progress**, comment ‚ÄúAgent started work on this ticket.‚Äù, and (optionally) log setup time.
- If no key is present, request one or have it added to scope before proceeding.
- When a key exists, always create the working branch and PR title prefixed with that identifier (e.g., `TR-1234-description`); recommended branch format: `tr-<num>-<short-slug>`.

Smart commit policy:
- All commit messages must include the Jira key(s) and smart commit tags.
- Format: `git commit -m "<PROJECT>-<int> <imperative summary> #comment <concise what/why> #time <duration> #transition In Review"`.
- The summary must be ‚â§72 chars and describe the outcome.
- `#comment` is a one-line reviewer-friendly note describing what changed and why.
- `#time` logs the effort (e.g., `12m`, `45m`, `1h 30m`).
- Only the final ready-for-review commit includes `#transition In Review`; keep intermediate commits in **In Progress**.
- Multiple tickets can be referenced by listing each key once (e.g., `TR-101 AUDIO-202 ...`).
- Ensure the Git author email matches a Jira user for smart-commit linkage.

Ticket lifecycle expectations (Board: To Do ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí In Review):
1. **Start/pickup** ‚Äì transition to **In Progress**, add the startup comment, optionally log initial time.
2. **During work** ‚Äì keep the ticket **In Progress**, post incremental commits with `<PROJECT>-<int>` keys and `#comment` tags, and perform Jira API updates as needed.
3. **Complete** ‚Äì final commit transitions to **In Review** using the smart commit format. Post a Jira comment summarizing work, total time logged, current status (**In Review**), and links back to the task run and PR/commit diff. Do **not** move to Done.
4. **Failures** ‚Äì if transitions fail, comment the error, retry with backoff (3 attempts), and proceed with manual follow-up instructions.
5. **Fallback** ‚Äì if Smart Commit automations are unavailable (permissions/workflow), explicitly post Jira comments, worklogs, and transitions through the API.

Jira API usage requires `JIRA_EMAIL` and `JIRA_PAT` to be available in the environment; derive the base URL as `https://mfisbv.atlassian.net` each run instead of reading a `JIRA_BASE_URL` variable. Read tokens from the environment only, redact PAT values in logs, and scope credentials minimally (issue read/write, worklog, transitions). Resolve transition IDs dynamically by name (‚ÄúIn Progress‚Äù, ‚ÄúIn Review‚Äù), and verify capabilities (`/myself`, read issue, list transitions, add comment/worklog) before first use. Remember that Jira ticket keys already embed the project prefix (`ABC-123` ‚áí project key `ABC`, `TR-456` ‚áí project key `TR`). Perform a self-check at startup to confirm transitions map correctly and permissions allow commenting/worklogging. On closeout, ensure total time logged and final status are reported in Jira comments.

Before pushing:
1. Run: git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<base-branch>
   - If rebase fails, discard local changes and re-run the implementation against the updated branch.
2. Run tests (export DEV=1 && pytest -q). All tests must pass.
3. Push back to the same branch on origin with:
   `git push origin HEAD:<branch-name>`.

Pull request hygiene:
- PR titles must begin with the Jira key (e.g., `TR-123: Fix ‚Ä¶`, `AUDIO-45: Update mixer`).
- Use the template sections: **What / Why**, **How (high-level)**, **Risk / Rollback**, **Links** (Jira issue, task run, preview URL).
- Keep commits small and logically grouped; document test coverage changes in `#comment`.

If you are reviewing another agent's PR:
- Always leave a short review comment summarizing what you did, test results, and risk assessment.
- If all tests pass and the PR is safe to merge, submit a formal GitHub PR review with ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù status (not just a üëç reaction).
- If there are issues or risks, submit a ‚ÄúComment‚Äù or ‚ÄúRequest changes‚Äù review instead, explaining why.
- Reactions (üëç) alone are not sufficient; every PR must have a visible comment and, when ready, a formal approval.

## Design & Architecture Impression (high-level guidance)
Tricorder is a moderately complex system where the complexity arises from its domain (real-time audio capture, concurrency, subprocess orchestration, and resource-constrained embedded deployment) rather than from ad-hoc structure. The project intentionally manages complexity by separating responsibilities into dedicated components (capture/segmenter, encoder, HLS tee, web streamer, ingest pipeline) and by using clear inter-process or inter-thread boundaries (queues, helper threads, subprocesses).

Contributors and automated agents should assume the codebase favors:
- explicit concurrency (threads + queues) and small, well-scoped modules rather than monolithic services;
- defensive error handling around IO and subprocesses (ffmpeg, ALSA, disk operations);
- proactive resource management to avoid memory or disk exhaustion on Pi Zero class hardware (tmpfs rotation, bounded queues, drop-oldest strategies);
- minimal, well-documented dependencies to keep deployments small and robust.

When modifying architecture or adding features, preserve these qualities: keep modules focused, prefer push-button diagnosticability, and avoid solutions that require heavy runtime resources unless gated by a config toggle and justified in `README.md`.

---

## Repository-wide guidelines
- Target Python **3.10** for compatibility with Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W; avoid language/runtime features that require newer interpreters.
- Keep dependencies lean. Prefer the standard library; document and justify any new third-party package in `README.md`, and update `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt`.
- Preserve existing logging approach (use `print(..., flush=True)` for critical runtime logs to keep `journalctl` ordering consistent). Helper log wrappers are OK if they do not hide boot logs.
- When modifying long-running daemons, ensure signal handling is clean and that subprocess pipes are closed. Mirror patterns in `lib/live_stream_daemon.py` and `lib/segmenter.py`.
- Update `README.md`, `config.yaml` (inline comments), and `updater.env-example` for any new tunables, services, or environment variables. Prefer tables/bulleted lists for discoverability.
- The web dashboard (`lib/web_streamer.py` and `lib/webui/`) is supported ‚Äî document UI/API changes in `README.md` and keep waveform generation details current.

---

## Design & Implementation Rules (practical)
- Respect module boundaries. If you need to add functionality that crosses components, introduce small, explicit APIs rather than inlining cross-cutting logic.
- Avoid blocking the main capture loop. Offload CPU or IO heavy tasks to background threads/processes and communicate via bounded queues.
- Use idempotent operations for storage and external effects where possible; prefer write-then-rename semantics for recorded files.
- When adding subprocess usage (eg. `ffmpeg`), include robust respawn/cleanup logic and failure telemetry.
- Be conservative with memory and CPU: assume Pi Zero class constraints by default. Add performance or feature gates for heavier processing (e.g., RNNoise/noisereduce).

---

## Things to always think about when editing code
- Understand the module‚Äôs runtime context (daemon, web UI, encoding pipeline) before proposing or committing changes.
- Prioritize safety: prefer non-breaking, reversible edits, and create tests for behavior changes.
- Preserve resource constraints and signal handling semantics. Do *not* introduce background threads or long-running tasks without an opt-in config.
- When proposing refactors, produce small PRs with clear tests and a short risk assessment (what can go wrong, how to rollback).
- Prefer to add feature flags / config knobs for expensive options and document default behavior.

---

## Python code style
- Module constants: `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE`. Functions/variables: `snake_case`.
- Type hints welcome when consistent; avoid mixing hinted/unhinted signatures without reason.
- Avoid broad `except:` blocks. Always log exceptions and scope `try/except` narrowly.
- Add docstrings where behavior is non-obvious (audio math, buffer semantics, filesystem guarantees).

---

## Frontend assets (lib/webui)
- Static assets are vanilla ES modules + plain CSS to remain compatible with Chromium/Firefox on Raspberry Pi OS.
- When editing dashboard JS/HTML/CSS run the UI tests: `pytest tests/test_web_dashboard.py` and `pytest tests/test_25_web_streamer.py`.
- Prefer small, testable modules and lazy load heavyweight UI pieces (waveform renderers, HLS player). Avoid introducing build steps that prevent the one-file static deploy model unless you also update install scripts and README.
- Document any UI/API changes in `README.md`.

---

## Shell scripts and systemd units
- Start scripts with `#!/usr/bin/env bash` and `set -euo pipefail`.
- Keep scripts POSIX-friendly; avoid GNU-only flags unless already used in the repo. Document exceptions.
- When editing units, keep matching `.service`/`.timer` pairs and document variables in `config.yaml`.

---

## Testing and validation
- Run `pytest -q` before submitting changes. If making a targeted change, run the specific module tests as well as the full suite.
- If changes affect installation/uninstallation, run `pytest tests/test_00_install.py` and/or `pytest tests/test_50_uninstall.py`.
- If touching shell scripts/systemd, prefer a dry run on a Raspberry Pi or document why that isn‚Äôt feasible.
- When adding features, add tests in `tests/` and document their intent in `README.md` and `tests/README.md`.
- New dependencies must be compatible with Ubuntu 24.04 LTS and Python 3.10.

---

## Documentation
- Keep `README.md` and `config.yaml` synchronized with code. Add release notes for behavior-changing edits.
- Document new configuration options inline in `config.yaml` and summarize them in `README.md`.
- When changing runtime behavior, update the architecture diagram and the ‚ÄúOperations‚Äù section in the README.

---

## Contribution workflow & PR guidance
- Small, focused PRs. Large architectural changes should be prefaced with an issue describing the proposed design, tradeoffs, and rollback plan.
- PRs must include:
  - a short description of the change,
  - a risk statement (how this impacts the recorder runtime),
  - test steps (local dev + Raspberry Pi when necessary),
  - updated docs for configs or runtime behavior.
- For high-risk changes (capture loop, encoding pipeline, HLS stream lifecycle), require at least one approval from a core maintainer and a successful run of the end-to-end audio test (if available).

---

## Appendix: Suggested developer mindset
- Be conservative: prefer clarity over cleverness when working on concurrency or IO code.
- Test in a hardware-like environment before shipping (Pi Zero 2 W or similar). [If you are an AI/LLM powered agent, this does not apply to you!]
- When adding heuristics (adaptive thresholding, VAD tuning), provide sane defaults, expose tunables, and document expected behavior and failure modes.
- When in doubt, open an issue describing the problem and a proposed minimal fix or experiment before changing production code. [If you are an AI/LLM powered agent, pause work and consult with the human who set you to task.]

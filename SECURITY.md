# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a security issue, please report it privately to the owner of this Project or use GitHub Security Advisories for this repository. Do NOT open a public issue for vulnerabilities.

Provide:
- Affected component (e.g., live_stream_daemon, web UI)
- Steps to reproduce or a proof-of-concept (if possible)
- Impact assessment (data exposure, remote code execution, etc.)
- Suggested mitigations (if any)

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and work on a fix. If you prefer a monetary bounty, include contact details and proposed terms.

## Supported versions
We support the `main` branch and the last tagged release. Older releases can be considered on a case-by-case basis.

## Disclosure timeline
After a fix is available, we will coordinate the public disclosure with the reporter and release a patched version and instructions for updating.
